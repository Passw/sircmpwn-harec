highest priorities, unordered except where there are obvious dependencies:

- double check integers <32 bits in gen
- named constants (true, false, null, void)
- aggregate types
	- in parameters
	- in variables
	- in return values
- field access, indexing
- function calls
- static let

This subset of features should allow us to address most of the problems with gen
that v1 suffered from, and end up with a solid basis from which we can
confidently implement the remainder of the features.
