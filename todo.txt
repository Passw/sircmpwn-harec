highest priorities, unordered except where there are obvious dependencies:

- lower implicit casts in check
- aggregate types
	- in parameters
	- in variables
	- in return values
- field access, indexing
- static let

This subset of features should allow us to address most of the problems with gen
that v1 suffered from, and end up with a solid basis from which we can
confidently implement the remainder of the features.

general todos, includes spec updates:
- zero-length arrays & slice initializers
- allocations
- assign arrays from other arrays (memcpy)
- pass arrays directly into function calls (alloc if needed flag?)
- casts
- implicit casts
