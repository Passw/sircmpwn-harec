highest priorities, unordered except where there are obvious dependencies:

- variable assignment
- simple binary and unary arithmetic
- refactor parser (and AST) to have each parse_* function return a heap
  allocated expression, rather than accept a pointer to one
- aggregate types
	- in parameters
	- in variables
	- in return values
- field access, indexing
- function calls
- static let
- pointers

This subset of features should allow us to address most of the problems with gen
that v1 suffered from, and end up with a solid basis from which we can
confidently implement the remainder of the features.
